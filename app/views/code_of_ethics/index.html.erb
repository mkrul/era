            These entail a commitment to upholding and promoting ethical practices, responsible governance, and
            the welfare of animals in our care. These standards are designed to assist us in assessing and
            recognizing rescues and shelters that demonstrate this commitment. ERA strongly encourages other animal welfare organizations to adopt these principles,
            fostering a collective effort towards creating a more compassionate and responsible landscape for animal rescue.
            Each principle holds immense importance in promoting integrity-driven approaches and accountable management
            within the rescue community.

                      Animal welfare is not only about the singular individual in front of us, but
                      also the well-being and care of all around us. We must understand the impact of
                      quality versus quantity. While the impulse to save as many animals as possible
                      is commendable, it is vital to shift our attention from the quantity of animals
                      saved to the quality of care provided. Acting on an understanding of physical,
                      mental, and emotional health and wellbeing will lead to accountability for every
                      animal placed in a home.

                      Equal opportunities for adoption and placement of animals should be
                      attainable, fair, and reasonable. Permanent foster situations are appropriate for
                      hospice cases. Biosecurity should be a primary focus for any and all animals within
                      rescue care. Honesty must become a forefront consideration when placing animals in
                      homes, as we should be focused on setting the animal and the family up for success,
                      and not a repeated reentry into the system and a drain on rescue resources.

                      Animals in rescue care should be on the path to a treatment plan for any and all
                      medical needs. Emotional health needs to be considered as important as physical health.
                      Euthanasia is an unfortunate reality and should be considered if an animal's quality of
                      life is in decline. While this can be hard on us at times, we need to lead by example to
                      do right by these animals no matter how it makes us feel. Not every case can be a success
                      story, but the care of every animal can be ethical.

                      Rescues should maintain a professional public presence both in person and
                      on social media. When discussing cases, there should be only factual statements presented,
                      not embellished stories to garner donor generosity. Appropriate and supportive partnerships
                      with shelters is a must.  Following all local laws, even when it is not what we want to do,
                      sets an example for those around us. Being positive and uplifting to all animal professionals
                      is vital to maintain an ethical public presence.

                      large outstanding medical debt. Offering thorough explanation of needs with evidential
                      documentation such as invoices and estimates should be done without prompting or request.
                      If at any time a donor requests a detailed history of use of funds, it should be made
                      available to them within a timely manner.

                      by local laws and continue to educate the public on the changes and intricacies of those laws.
                      Rescues should educate the public on animal welfare and all that goes into it, both the
