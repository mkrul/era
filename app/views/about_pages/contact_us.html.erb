                    Applying for ERA accreditation is a multi-step process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1) Send a one-time fee of $75 to ERA via <%= link_to 'PayPal', @paypal_url, target: '_blank' %>, <%= link_to 'Venmo', @venmo_url, target: '_blank' %>, or <%= link_to 'CashApp', @cashapp_url, target: '_blank' %>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2) Fill out and submit your <%= link_to 'application', 'https://forms.gle/MeuWpkQyCRj2ky63A', target: '_blank' %>.
                    Don't forget to include tax status documentation and a screenshot proving that that you have paid the application fee.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    3) Wait for ERA to contact you.  It can take up to two weeks for our volunteers to review your application.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    4) Your rescue will be awarded accreditation status if the organization is found to
                    be sufficiently aligned with ERA's <%= link_to "Code of Ethics", code_of_ethics_path %>.  If the organization does not meet
                    ERA's criteria, you may re-apply at any time once the necessary improvements have been made.

                    At this time the application fee is set at $75. This will be utilized to pay for operational

                    This is on a case-by-case basis.  If there are enough concerns raised within a calendar year, a
                    rescue or shelter goes into a probationary period.  If a rescue or shelter gets an infraction, this
                    could bump their accreditation status down or have their accreditation revoked entirely depending
                    on the severity of the offense.

                  <p>
                    Each violation will be examined in context, with focus on assisting
                    the rescue with making more ethical decisions in the future rather than punishing them. We want to
                    ensure that any type of report we receive is a valid infraction and not retaliatory in nature.
