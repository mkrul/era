                  The backgrounds and qualifications of our Board members are listed under their biographies
                  on the What Is Era? page. The Board of Directors currently consists of a rescue director
                  and veterinary technician, two professional trainers, an ethical breeder, an animal

                  We are believers in the humane hierarchy, but we also believe in being realistic and
                  respectful of the fact that resources in rescue are limited, and that balanced training
                  is sometimes necessary.  However, we do not condone compulsion training in any form.

                  Silver, and Gold-level certifications will be made publicly available (coming soon).

                  We are a strictly volunteer-run organization and will not be able to police individual rescues
                  for unethical behavior. However, ERA-accredited rescues will be at risk of losing their accreditation
                  status if they are found to be in violation of the Code of Ethics.  The website will have a reporting
                  form if there is an ethical concern surrounding an ERA-accredited rescue (coming soon).

                  Only dogs at this time, but as we grow and get established, we hope to expand first to cats,
                  and then to other species as those more knowledgeable show interest and we have a committee
                  qualified to perform the same accreditation duties for other companion animals.

                  At this time the application fee is set at $75. This will be utilized to pay for operational
                  expenses, and we hope to distribute excess funds back to the community. How this will be accomplished
                  is undetermined at this time, but it is being discussed.

                  At the moment, no. This is 100% a grass-roots movement. Government has failed to address these issues
                  time and again. At this point, we believe that if change is going to happen soon, it needs to start
                  from the ground up.

                  This is on a case-by-case basis.  Tf there are enough concerns raised within a calendar year, a
                  rescue or shelter goes into a probationary period.  If a rescue or shelter gets infractions, this
                  could bump their accreditation status down or have their accreditation revoked entirely depending
                  on the severity of the offense. Each violation will be examined in context, with focus on assisting
                  the rescue with making more ethical decisions in the future rather than punishing them. We want to
                  ensure that any type of report we receive is a valid infraction and not retaliatory in nature.

                  While we cannot require any rescue to have ERA certification, we hope that ERA gains enough
                  positive reputation that organizations will influence one another to join, and there will
                  be numerous perks and benefits of joining ERA (coming soon).
