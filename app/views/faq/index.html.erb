                    Does ERA support animal rights?
                  </h5>

                  <p>
                    Animal rights advocacy is based in the belief that animals should have inherent rights, such as the
                    right to life and the freedom to live as they wish, without being used by humans. Conversely, animal welfare
                    emphasizes making practical improvements in the lives of animals while working within existing systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While animal rights has brought attention to important ethical considerations, it has also contributed to
                    challenges within the landscape of animal rescue. For example, the belief that animals should not be used by
                    humans has led to the demonization of ethical preservation breeders. This has resulted in a lack of understanding
                    of the role that ethical breeders play in animal welfare, and has contributed to the belief that all breeders
                    are bad. Extreme animal rights positions can also lead to shelters and rescue organizations facing criticism when
                    they must make difficult decisions about euthanasia and medical care that may not fit within an absolutist perspective.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It's important to note that not all animal rights perspectives contribute negatively to the animal
                    welfare crisis.  However, we believe that a more practical approach that focuses on well-being and minimizing
                    suffering will allow us to work more effectively to improve the lives of animals in rescues and shelters.

                    ERA believes that ethical breeders play a vital role in combating the animal welfare crisis,
                    and that breeders who prioritize responsible practices, health, and the preservation of breed standards
                    should be supported by the community.  We also believe that the term "breeder" should not be used as a
                    pejorative to describe unethical puppy mills and backyard breeders.

                    Applying for ERA accreditation is a multi-step process.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1) Send a one-time fee of $75 to ERA via <%= link_to 'PayPal', @paypal_url, target: '_blank' %>, <%= link_to 'Venmo', @venmo_url, target: '_blank' %>, or <%= link_to 'CashApp', @cashapp_url, target: '_blank' %>

                  <p>
                    2) Fill out and submit your <%= link_to 'application', 'https://forms.gle/MeuWpkQyCRj2ky63A', target: '_blank' %>.
                    Don't forget to include tax status documentation and a screenshot proving that that you have paid the application fee.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    3) Wait for ERA to contact you.  It can take up to two weeks for our volunteers to review your application.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    4) Your rescue will be awarded accreditation status if the organization is found to
                    be sufficiently aligned with ERA's <%= link_to "Code of Ethics", code_of_ethics_path %>.  If the organization does not meet
                    ERA's criteria, you may re-apply at any time once the necessary improvements have been made.

                    This is on a case-by-case basis.  If there are enough concerns raised within a calendar year, a
                    rescue or shelter goes into a probationary period.  If a rescue or shelter gets an infraction, this
                    could bump their accreditation status down or have their accreditation revoked entirely depending
