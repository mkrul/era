                      While we are not able to police individual rescues for unethical behavior, ERA-accredited rescues will be at risk of losing their accreditation
                      status if they are found to be in violation of the <%= link_to "Code of Ethics", code_of_ethics_path %>.  The website will have a reporting

                      No, never.  ERA's focus is on promoting a culture of growth and continuous improvement. We believe that
                      the best way to address unethical practices in rescue is through education and mentorship, not public shaming.
                      We will not be publishing the names of rescues that have been denied accreditation or had their accreditation

                      At the moment, no. This is a 100% grass-roots movement. Government has failed to address these issues
                      time and again. We believe that if change is going to happen, it needs to start from the ground up.

                      This is on a case-by-case basis.  If there are enough concerns raised within a calendar year, a
                      rescue or shelter goes into a probationary period.  If a rescue or shelter gets an infraction, this
                      could bump their accreditation status down or have their accreditation revoked entirely depending
                      on the severity of the offense.

                      Each violation will be examined in context, with focus on assisting
                      the rescue with making more ethical decisions in the future rather than punishing them. We want to
                      ensure that any type of report we receive is a valid infraction and not retaliatory in nature.

                      ERA is aiming to shift the focus from an animal rights driven world back to animal welfare, and this starts
                      with education on these topics for the public. By providing an accreditation process, we aim to educate the
                      public on how to determine what organizations to support and how to identify them. As ERA grows, we will be
                      expanding on resources offered strictly to accredited organizations, as well as building a publicly accessible
                      library of resources on various topics. Through supporting this change, your rescue will be supported.

                      By taking a stance on ethics rooted in Animal Welfare within the animal rescue space and distancing ourselves

                      the best way to address unethical practices in rescue is through education and mentorship, not public shaming.

                      This is on a case-by-case basis.  If there are enough concerns raised within a calendar year, a
                      rescue or shelter goes into a probationary period.  If a rescue or shelter gets an infraction, this
                      could bump their accreditation status down or have their accreditation revoked entirely depending
                      on the severity of the offense.

                      ensure that any type of report we receive is a valid infraction and not retaliatory in nature.

                      Animal rights advocacy is based in the belief that animals should have inherent rights, such as the
                      right to life and the freedom to live as they wish. Conversely, animal welfare emphasizes making practical
                      improvements in the lives of animals while working within existing systems.

                    <p>
                      Animal rights has brought attention to important ethical considerations, but it has also contributed to
                      challenges within the landscape of animal rescue. It is important to note that not all animal rights perspectives
                      contribute negatively to the animal welfare crisis. However, we believe that a more practical approach that focuses
                      on well-being and minimizing suffering will allow us to work more effectively to improve the lives of animals in
                      rescues and shelters.

                      While the no-kill movement has brought attention to the importance of saving lives, it has also contributed to

                      lives of animals in rescues and shelters rather than on saving every life at all costs.  We believe that euthanasia
                      is a necessary evil, and that sometimes it is the most humane option for an animal that is suffering mentally or physically.

                      allowing an animal to be born into a world that is overpopulated with animals that are already in
                      need of homes. We believe that the resources put towards birthing litters, vaccinating and deworming them,
