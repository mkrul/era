            <%= tab %>Brittnea has always had a passion for animals and
            animal welfare. Her journey into animal welfare started back in 2006 where
            she volunteered at a veterinary clinic. From there, she went in to have many
            various jobs in the animal industry where she ended up as an Animal Control
            Officer.

            <%= tab %>After seeing multiple unethical practices amongst rescues
            and backyard breeders, Brittnea decided to turn to social media to find like
            minded people interested in educating the hard subjects. In doing so, she
            stumbled upon a wonderful group of ladies who all prioritized the idea that
            rescues can and should be ethical among other things. The creation of ERA is
            a light, showing that the future of rescue can be bright.
